albert_south is a boundary in-link leading into vocation.
Using the information in scenario1, the cycle time of vocation is 60 seconds.

		equals(defaultgreentime(vocation_stage0),35),
		equals(defaultgreentime(vocation_stage1),15),
		equals(interlimit(vocation_stage0),5),
		equals(interlimit(vocation_stage1),5).
	
The turnrate out of albert_south is the sum of turnrates of all its possible 
traffic links:

		equals(turnrate(vocation_stage1,albert_south,station_east),0.2),
		equals(turnrate(vocation_stage1,albert_south,new_west),0.2).

During stage 1 of vocation, traffic escapes from only albert_south. Total turnrate
is 0.4 PCUs/second.

Average flow out needs to be at least as much as the average flow in. Average flow
into albert_south from the outside world is:

		equals(turnrate(fake,outside,albert_south),0.08).

This shows the average flow into albert_south from the outside world is 0.08
PCUs/second. If minimum required greentime is denoted as 'X', then:

		X * 0.4/60 = 0.08
		X = (60*0.08)/0.4
		So X = 12 seconds

Therefore, the greentime of vocation_stage1 must be at least 12 seconds so that
queues do not build up on Albert Street (in theory).

Since cycle lengths are fixed, the greentime of vocation_stage0 must also be
adjusted. If vocation_stage0 greentime is denoted as 'Y', then:

		Y = 60-12-5-5
		So Y = 38 seconds

Therefore, the greentime of vocation_stage0 must be adjusted to 38 seconds
accordingly.

hepton_south is a boundary in-link leading into fox.
Using the information in scenario1, the cycle time of fox is 50 seconds.

		equals(defaultgreentime(fox_stage0),30),
		equals(defaultgreentime(fox_stage1),10),
		equals(interlimit(fox_stage0),5),
		equals(interlimit(fox_stage1),5).

The turnrate out of hepton_south is the sum of turnrates of all its possible 
traffic links:

		equals(turnrate(fox_stage1,hepton_south, market_east),0.1),
		equals(turnrate(fox_stage1,hepton_south, stubbings_west),0.1).
		
During stage 1 of fox, traffic escapes from only hepton_south. Total turnrate
is 0.2 PCUs/second.

Average flow out needs to be at least as much as the average flow in. Average flow
into hepton_south from the outside world is:

		equals(turnrate(fake,outside,hepton_south),0.02).
		
This shows the average flow into hepton_south from the outside world is 0.02
PCUs/second. If minimum required greentime is denoted as 'X', then:

		X * 0.2/50 = 0.02
		X = (50*0.02)/0.2
		So X = 5 seconds

Therefore, the greentime of fox_stage1 must be at least 5 seconds so that queues
do not build up on Hepton Road (in theory).

Since cycle lengths are fixed, the greentime of fox_stage0 must also be adjusted.
If fox_stage0 greentime is denoted as 'Y', then:

		Y = 50-5-5-5
		So Y = 35 seconds

Therefore, the greentime of fox_stage0 must be adjusted to 35 seconds
accordingly.

If these stage lengths were put into operation in a simulation, these stage
lengths may not be adequate if: by calculating the optimal length for one
stage of a junction, adjusting it accordingly, and adjusting the opposite
stage inversely leads to large queues forming at the in-link associated with
the stage that was adjusted without optimisation.
